### Launch terminal

In this short tutorial, you can try Towhee for yourself in this browser-based scenario. To begin, click the "Launch Terminal" button below.

<KatacodaBtn /><br />



Clicking on any of the code snippets below will automatically paste the contents of the snippet into the terminal you just launched. Once you close this page, the environment that you just spun up along with all of its contents will be wiped clean.

### Install Towhee

The browser-based terminal you just brought up is a completely clean environment, so we'll need to install Towhee first:
(click the following command, it will be copied to the terminal)

Download the source code from github.

<KatacodaBlock>git clone https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee.git</KatacodaBlock>


Go into the towhee directory.

<KatacodaBlock>cd towhee</KatacodaBlock><br />

Install towhee with latest codes.

<KatacodaBlock>python3 setup.py install</KatacodaBlock><br />


### Some prep work

Once that's done, let's get started with a bit of prep work. Download our Towhee logo (or any other image); we'll use this to generate an embedding vector:

<KatacodaBlock>cd ../</KatacodaBlock><br />

Download the test image.

<KatacodaBlock>wget https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee-docs/raw/main/static/img/logo.png</KatacodaBlock><br />

### Running your first pipeline

Now it's time to generate your first embedding with Towhee! Open up a `python` terminal:

<KatacodaBlock>python3</KatacodaBlock><br />

Data transformations are central to Towhee; Pipelines are simply a series of transformations connected together in a directed acyclic graph. All pre-built Towhee pipelines are given names that are representative of the task at hand. To create a pipeline, import the `pipeline` function from the `towhee`:

<KatacodaBlock>from towhee import pipeline</KatacodaBlock><br />

Now let's instantiate an image embedding pipeline:

<KatacodaBlock>embedding_pipeline = pipeline('image-embedding')</KatacodaBlock><br />

And then pass the image we just downloaded through the pipeline:

<KatacodaBlock>output = embedding_pipeline('logo.png')</KatacodaBlock>

That's it! The embedding vector for the corresponding input image (`towhee_logo.png`) is stored in the `output` variable:

<KatacodaBlock>print(output)</KatacodaBlock><br />

### Other pipelines

Note that the default model used by `image-embedding` is `Resnet50` (you can find the corresponding mapping for default pipelines [here](https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee/blob/main/towhee/__init__.py#L25)). The default repository for this pipeline is located on the [Towhee hub](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-resnet50); following the link will take you to a README page describing the pipeline, the model(s) used, and a simple diagram explaining how data flows through the pipeline.

We can also try a different image embedding pipeline instead of the default one. Towhee provides a way to directly call a pipeline repository on the Towhee hub:

<KatacodaBlock>
  embedding_pipeline = pipeline('image-embedding-resnet101')
</KatacodaBlock><br />

This automatically loads the pipeline located at `towhee/image-embedding-resnet101` on the Towhee hub.

<KatacodaBlock>quit()</KatacodaBlock><br />

### Try more pipelines

A summary of image embedding pipelines can be found at [here](pipelines/image-embedding). In addition, it is highly-recommended to browse the [hub](https://hub.towhee.io/pipelines) for more interesting pipelines.
