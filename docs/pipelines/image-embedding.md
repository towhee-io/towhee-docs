## Pre-built image embedding pipelines

This is a summary of available image embedding pipelines in [towhee.hub](https://hub.towhee.io/). These reusable pipelines simplify the code for image embedding extraction, which can be used for image search, attention analysis, feature extraction backbone for later models.

- Supported modes for embedding pipelines
  - Resnet: [50](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-resnet50), [101](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-resnet101) and so on
  - Effficientnet: [b5](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-efficientnetb5), [b7](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-efficientnetb7) and so on
  - Swin Transformer: [base](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-swinbase), small, large and so on
  - Vision Transformer: [tiny](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-vitlarge), small, base, large and so on

Try pipelines above with hyperlink. Different models can also be used for image embedding pipeline by simple configuration .
